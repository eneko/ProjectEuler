Project Euler - My Solutions
============================
**DISCLAIMER:** This repository contains my personal solutions, implemented in multiple programming languages, to the Project Euler problems (see www.projecteuler.net). Beware of the spoilers. **Do not look at these solutions unless you have already solved the problems yourself**.

To make it easier to share and review solutions, each solution is standalone and contained on a single file. All solutions are executable on the command line.


Current Solutions
-----------------
| Problem | Scala | Python | Objective-C | Javascript | PHP |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Problem 8 | Solved | Solved | Solved | In Progress |  |
| Problem 9 | Solved |  |  |  |  |
| Problem 10 | Solved |  |  |  |  |
| Problem 11 | Solved |  |  |  |  |
| Problem 12 | Solved (very slow solution) |  |  |  |  |

Running the solutions on the command line
-----------------------------------------

###Scala
    $ scala scala/problem8.scala

###Python
    $ python python/problem8.py

###Objective-C
	# Compile project in XCode
	# Run binary file

###Javascript
    $ node javascript/problem8.js

###PHP
    $ php php/problem8.js



Timing the solutions
--------------------

Solutions can be timed for performance analysis using the unix `time` command, although this will include time to start the process and/or compilation time in the case of the `scala` command.

    $ time scala scala/problem8.scala
