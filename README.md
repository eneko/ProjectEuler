**WARNING:** This repository contains solutions in multiple languages to the problems proposed at www.projecteuler.net. Beware of the spoilers. You should not look at these solutions **unless you have already solved the problems yourself**.


Project Euler - My Solutions
============================
This repository contains my personal solutions to Project Euler problems (visit www.projecteuler.net for reference), implemented in multiple programming languages. Some of the solutions may have different variants.

To make it easier to share and review solutions, each one is standalone and contained on a single file. All solutions are also executable on the command line.


Current Solutions
-----------------
| Problem | Scala | Python | Objective-C | Javascript | PHP |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Problem 8 | Solved | Solved | Solved | In Progress |  |
| Problem 9 | Solved |  |  |  |  |


Running the solutions on the command line
-----------------------------------------

###Scala
    $ scala scala/problem8.scala

###Python
    $ python python/problem8.py

###Objective-C
	# Compile project in XCode
	# Run binary file

###Javascript
    $ node javascript/problem8.js

###PHP
    $ php php/problem8.js



Timing the solutions
--------------------

Solutions can be timed for performance analysis using the unix `time` command, although this will include time to start the process and/or compilation time in the case of the `scala` command.

    $ time scala scala/problem8.scala
